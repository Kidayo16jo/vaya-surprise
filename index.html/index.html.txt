        <h2>A Special Message</h2>
        <p>To my love,</p>
        <p>Every moment with you feels like a piece of heaven on Earth. With you by my side, I feel at home, wrapped in the warmth of your presence. I want you to know that you are cherished beyond words, and there’s nothing I wouldn’t do to see you smile. I promise to always be here, through the laughter and the tears, holding you close and keeping you safe. You are my joy, my peace, and my greatest gift.</p>
        <p>With all my love, forever and always.</p>
        <p><strong>Vaya</strong> – <em>"Journey" in Spanish, because every moment with you is an adventure I cherish.</em></p>
